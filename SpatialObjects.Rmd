## Lesson Goals

* Understand R representation of vector and raster spatial data
* Familiarity with R packages for reading, writing, and dealing with vector and raster data
* Understand spatial file types supported by R spatial packages
* Learn to pull spatial data from online sources into R

### Spatial Data

We can represent spatial data as discrete locations (points, lines or polygons) or as continuous phenomena without natural boundaries. We typically represent the former type of data (discrete locations) as *vector* data, with an associated geometry or shape, and some attributes with information about the locations.  Examples are: 

* state boundaries with state name and population
* rivers with their flow volume and names
* polygons of watersheds with their names and associated landscape information  

We represent the latter type of data (continuous spatial fields) with *rasters* - these would be things such as elevation, precipitation, and atmospheric deposition for instance.


Basic data structures in R can represent spatial data - all we need is some vectors with location and attribute information - below we generate cites with population and make a map with a legend:

```{r cities, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
cities <- c('Ashland','Corvallis','Bend','Portland','Newport')
longitude <- c(-122.699, -123.275, -121.313, -122.670, -124.054)
latitude <- c(42.189, 44.57, 44.061, 45.523, 44.652)
population <- c(20062,50297,61362,537557,9603)
locs <- cbind(longitude, latitude) 
plot(locs, cex=sqrt(population*.0002), pch=20, col='red', 
  main='Population', xlim = c(-124,-120.5), ylim = c(42, 46))
text(locs, cities, pos=4)

# Add a legend
breaks <- c(20000, 50000, 60000, 100000)
options(scipen=3)
legend("topright", legend=breaks, pch=20, pt.cex=1+breaks/20000, 
  col='red', bg='gray')
```

We can add a random polygon and map this as well:
```{r cities2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
cities <- c('Ashland','Corvallis','Bend','Portland','Newport')
longitude <- c(-122.699, -123.275, -121.313, -122.670, -124.054)
latitude <- c(42.189, 44.57, 44.061, 45.523, 44.652)
population <- c(20062,50297,61362,537557,9603)
locs <- cbind(longitude, latitude) 
plot(locs, cex=sqrt(population*.0002), pch=20, col='red', 
  main='Population', xlim = c(-124,-120.5), ylim = c(42, 46))
text(locs, cities, pos=4)

# Add a legend
breaks <- c(20000, 50000, 60000, 100000)
options(scipen=3)
legend("topright", legend=breaks, pch=20, pt.cex=1+breaks/20000, 
  col='red', bg='gray')

# Add polygon
lon <- c(-123.5, -123.5, -122.5, -122.670, -123)
lat <- c(43, 45.5, 44, 43, 43)
x <- cbind(lon, lat)
polygon(x, border='blue')
lines(x, lwd=3, col='red')
points(x, cex=2, pch=20)
```

We can see in this toy example that numeric vectors can represent locations in R for simple mapping.  Points just need to be a pair of numbers in cartesian space, and lines and polygons are just a number of these points (note that polygons are closed by having their first point coincide with last point which the `polygon` function in base R graphics takes care of). 

You can do simple things with this spatial representation using basic R structures, but it breaks down quickly if you want to ask any spatial questions - for instance using the example above, how would we figure out the nearest city to Corvallis? Or imagine the polygon is a county and we wanted to know what cities are within the county?

So what information do we need to properly define spatial vector data and perform spatial operations?

* A coordinate reference system
* A bounding box or extent
* ?

### Vector Data with sp
We're going to quickly review how spatial data was standardized in recent years using the base package `sp`.  It's informative to understand the structure of `sp` objects, and a number of packages still depend on `sp`, but this is changing rapidly and the R spatial vector world is rapdily moving toward adaptation of the newer `sf` package, so the bulk of our vector work will be using `sf`.

One reason it's worth still going over `sp`, even though you'll soon find `sf` is far superior in a number of ways, is that numerous packages are currently built using the `sp` object structure, so there's a need to learn it to navigate current R spatial ecosystem. The image below is from [Colin Gillespie's recent tweet](https://twitter.com/csgillespie/status/854438264538845184) showing major packages and dependies in R:

![CRANdependencies](/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/img/CRANdependencies.jpg)

And below is a figure (with corresponding code you can run) that I put together based on a figure in [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) - the take home is that sp is still the most-used spatial package in R despite the growth of `sf`.


```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("metacran/cranlogs")
library(cranlogs)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
stats <- cran_downloads(from = "2013-01-01", to = "2018-08-22",packages = c("sp", "sf", "raster", "ggmap", "mapview"))

monthly_stats <- stats %>% 
  group_by(month=floor_date(date, "month"), package) %>%
  summarize(amount=sum(count))
ggplot(monthly_stats, aes(x=month, y=amount, group = package, colour = package)) + geom_line() 
```

Handling of spatial data in R was standardized in recent years through the base package `sp`, which uses 'new-style' [S4](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html) classes in R that use formal class definitions and are closer to object-oriented systems than standard S3 classes in R.  

The best source to learn about `sp` and fundamentals of spatial analysis in R is Roger Bivand's book [Applied Spatial Data Analysis in R](http://www.asdar-book.org/)

`sp` objects inherit from the basic spatial class, which has two 'slots' in R new-style class lingo.  From the Bivand book above, here's what this looks like (Blue at top of each box is the class name, items in white are the slots, arrows show inheritance between classes):

![SpatialClassesFig1](/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/img/SpatialClassesFig1.png)

Let's take a look at this in R - run the following R code in your R console (or from source):
```{r spatial class, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(sp)
getClass("Spatial")
```

We can see from this that a basic `sp` spatial object has to have two 'slots' - a bounding box and a 'proj4string' - this is the prefered format in R for a coordinate reference system (CRS) - either projected or unprojected.  We can also see, from the figure above, that building off of the `Spatial` class, to have a `SpatialPoints`object we also need the actual matrix of coordinates that define those points.  From there, we can build up to a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` by simply adding a data frame of attributes to associate with those points.  Let's step through creating an `sp` `SpatialPointsDataFrame` using our hypothetical cities data we created earlier.

```{r example spatial, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
cities <- c('Ashland','Corvallis','Bend','Portland','Newport')
longitude <- c(-122.699, -123.275, -121.313, -122.670, -124.054)
latitude <- c(42.189, 44.57, 44.061, 45.523, 44.652)
population <- c(20062,50297,61362,537557,9603)
coords <- data.frame(longitude, latitude)
dat <- data.frame(cities, population)
pts <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, dat)
print(dat)
print(pts)
```

We first created vectors of city names, latitude, longitude, and population. Then we made a matix of the longitude and latitude vectors (note that convention is always longitude first!). Then we construct a data frame of our city names and population.  Finally, we use `SpatialPointsDataFrame` as a method call on our matrix of coordinates and data frame to generate a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object. 

Conveniently, our base R `plot` method works with our newly created `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, and we can add labels as well one way using the `maptools` package:

```{r plot spatial, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(maptools)
plot(pts, axes=T)
pointLabel(coordinates(pts),labels=pts$cities)
```

Pop quiz - why doesn't this initial map look quite right?

Hint - run summary on pts:
```{r summary, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
summary(pts)
```

The summary method on our `SpatialPointsDataFrame` gives us a nice quick synopsis of the 'slots' that make up our `sp` object - `str` shows the full detail:

```{r st, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
str(pts)
```

Meet your new friend the `@` symbol - this is how you access slots in an `S4` object in R - you can think of as similar to `$` in accessing columns in a data frame.

So to get the bounding box of our `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, we simply do:
```{r bbox, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pts@bbox
```

Or you can use the method directly:
```{r bbox2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
bbox(pts)
```

Here's an example list of some of the available methods in `sp` and what they do - see package help for comprehensive list:

method/class | and what it does
------------ | ----------------
`bbox(x)` | returns the bounding box coordinates
`proj4string(x)` | sets or retrieves projection attributes using the CRS object.
`CRS()` | creates an object of class of coordinate reference system arguments
`spplot(x)` | plots a separate map of all the attributes unless specified otherwise
`coordinates(x)` | returns a matrix with the spatial coordinates. For spatial polygons it returns the centroids.
`over(x, y)` | used for example to retrieve the polygon or grid indexes on a set of points - we'll come back to that one later
`spsample(x)` | sampling of spatial points within the spatial extent of objects

#### **A quick foray into coordinate reference systems and projections**
Coordinate reference system, or CRS, information in `sp` uses the `proj4string` format.  A very handy site to use to lookup any projection and get it's `proj4string` format is [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/).  A handy resource put together by Melanie Frazier for an R spatial workshop we did several years ago, is here: [Overview of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) in R](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf).

Dealing with coordinate reference systems and projections is a big part of working with spatial data in R, and it's relatively straightforward once you get the hang of it.  Here are some of the fundamentals:

* CRS can be geographic (lat/lon), projected, or NA in R
* Data with different CRS MUST be transformed to common CRS in R
* Projections in `sp` are provided in PROJ4 strings in the proj4string slot of an object
* [http://www.spatialreference.org/](http://www.spatialreference.org/)
* Useful `rgdal` package functions:
    * projInfo(type='datum')
    * projInfo(type='ellps')
    * projInfo(type='proj')
* For `sp` class objects:
    * To get the CRS: proj4string(x)
    * To assign the CRS:
        * Use either EPSG code or PROJ.4:
            * proj4string(x) <- CRS("+init=epsg:4269")
            * proj4string(x) <- CRS("+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=WGS84")
    * To transform CRS
        * x <- spTransform(x, CRS("+init=epsg:4238"))
        * x <- spTransform(x, proj4string(y))
    * For rasters (we'll focus on rasters later, but mention projections here):
        * To get the CRS: projection(x)
        * To transform CRS: projectRaster(x)

To get back to our `SpatialPointsDataFrame` we created, hopefully everyone realizes the issue with our original map shape was that our data was unprojected, and actually lacking any coordinate reference system information whatsoever.  We have to supply this to our CRS slot for our pts `SpatialPointsDataFrame`.  We know we're using latitude and longitude values, and usually it's safe to assume those are either NAD83 Datum or WGS84 - we don't need to worry about delving into the details here.  We can lookup the correct `proj4string` either using [http://www.spatialreference.org/](http://www.spatialreference.org/) or the `projInfo` method in the `rgdal` package.

Try one of these methods to get the CRS information we need to supply for our points.

Solution:

```{r CRS, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pts@proj4string <- CRS('+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 
                        +datum=NAD83 +no_defs')
summary(pts)
```

And let's plot again 
```{r map, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
plot(pts, axes=T)
pointLabel(coordinates(pts),labels=pts$cities)
```

Better - but what did you notice from summary(pts) above in the `proj4string` information?

We should not just use a geographic CRS, but project to a planar CRS for a better looking map - NAD83 / Oregon Lambert is a good choice - see if you can find the `proj4string` for this(hint: EPSG code is 2991) and take a minute to look through help for `sp` package and see if anyone knows how we'd get our pts to this projection.

```{r CRS2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(rgdal)
pts <- spTransform(pts, CRS('+proj=lcc +lat_1=43 +lat_2=45.5 +lat_0=41.75 +lon_0=-120.5 +x_0=400000 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs'))
# NOTE# You can also simply use the EPSG code if projection has
pts <- spTransform(pts, CRS('+init=epsg:2991'))
summary(pts)
```

And now how does it look when we map it? We're adding a step below using the `getData` function in the `raster` package to bring in a counties background - we'll look at `raster` more in a bit:
```{r map2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(raster)
US <- getData("GADM",country="USA",level=2)
OR <-US[US$NAME_1=='Oregon',]
proj4string(pts) == proj4string(OR)
OR <- spTransform(OR, CRS(proj4string(pts)))
plot(OR, axes=T)
plot(pts, add=T)
pointLabel(coordinates(pts),labels=pts$cities)
```

Now let's take a quick look at lines and polygons in `sp`. We'll see how these objects are stored in `sp` to gain a basic understanding, but we'll then move to the newer `sf` package for all our vector example exercises.

![SpatialClassesFig2](/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/img/SpatialClassesFig2.png)

By contructing toy `SpatialLines` and `SpatialPolygons` `sp` objects, and then `SpatialLinesDataFrames` and `SpatialPolygonsDataFrames`, we can get a get a feel for the additional details needed to structure these using `sp`. Example here is from [R Spatial](http://rspatial.org/spatial/rst/3-vectordata.html).  Here we use the `raster` package which has handy `spLines` and `spPolys` functions to create `SpatialLines` and `SpatialPolygons` from coordinates(`raster` package has several useful functions for dealing with vector data as well as raster data).

```{r lines, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(raster)
lon <- c(-116.8, -114.2, -112.9, -111.9, -114.2, -115.4, -117.7)
lat <- c(41.3, 42.9, 42.4, 39.8, 37.6, 38.3, 37.6)
lonlat <- cbind(lon, lat)
lns <- spLines(lonlat, crs='+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84')
lns
```

```{r polys, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pols <- spPolygons(lonlat, crs='+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84')
pols
```

```{r plot_lines_polys, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
plot(pols, axes=TRUE, las=1)
```

Take minute to examine the way `sp` structures these data in slots - use the various methods we've discussed so far to examine, such as `@`, `str`, and direct method calls on the objects.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
str(lns)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
str(pols)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
lns@bbox
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
proj4string(lns)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Eacb polygon element has it's own 5 slots to record information for that polygon
slotNames(pols@polygons[[1]])
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Here we access the area and label point (centroid) of our polygon using slots
pols@polygons[[1]]@labpt
pols@polygons[[1]]@area
```

And just a quick example of reading in a .csv file with latitude and longitude values to create an `sp` `SpatialPointsDataFrame`:
```{r read_csv, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
require(RCurl)
gages <- read.csv(text = getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhweber/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/gh-pages/data/StreamGages.csv'))
head(gages)    
```

There are shortcuts to do this, but explicitly we will:

* define the CRS
* make a matrix of our latitude and longitude values
* use the `sp` `SpatialPoints` method to combine our matrix and CRS into a `SpatialPoints` object
* Fold the data frame of values back into the `data` slot in a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`

```{r make_spatial, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
llCRS <- CRS("+init=epsg:4269")
coords <- gages[, c('LON_SITE', 'LAT_SITE')]
# now stitch together the data frame coordinate fields and the  
# projection string to createa SpatialPoints object
gages_sp <- SpatialPoints(coords, proj4string = llCRS)
# summary method gives a description of the spatial object in R
summary(gages_sp)
```

```{r spatialdataframe, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
gages_spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(gages_sp, gages)
summary(gages_spdf)
```

And a quick look at our gages using plot and plotting PNW states:
```{r mapgages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
PNW <-US[US$NAME_1 %in% c('Oregon','Washington','Idaho'),]
PNW <- spTransform(PNW, CRS(proj4string(gages_spdf)))
plot(PNW, axes=T)
plot(gages_spdf, col='blue', add=T)
```
### Vector Data with sf
The `sf` package developed by Edzer Pebesma ia an implementation of [Simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features), an open standard developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Simple Features is a hierarchical data model that represents a wide range of geometry types - it includes all common vector geometry types(but does not include raster) and even allows geometry collections, which can have multiple geometry types in a single object.

The `sf` package developed by Edzer Pebesma ia an implementation of [Simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features), an open standard developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Simple Features is a hierarchical data model that represents a wide range of geometry types - it includes all common vector geometry types(but does not include raster) and even allows geometry collections, which can have multiple geometry types in a single object.  From the first `sf` package vignette we see:

![`sf` Objects](/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/img/sf_objects.png)

The big difference between `sf` and `sp` is that `sf` usesS3 classes rather than S4 as `sp` does.  Simple features are simple `data.frame` objects that have a geometry list-column, essentially.  `sf` rolls together the functions of three packages from the `sp` world - `sp` for the class system, `rgdal` for reading and writing data, and `rgeos` for spatial operations using [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos). The simple feature model will be familiar to folks who use [PostGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostGIS), [MySQL Spatial Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL), [Oracle Spatial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Spatial_and_Graph), the [OGR component of the GDAL library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL), [GeoJSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7946/) and [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) in Python.  Simple features are represented with Well-Known text - [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) - and well-known binary formats.

Just as in `PostGIS`, all functions and methods in `sf` are prefixed with `st_`, which stands for 'spatial and temporal'.  An advantage of this prefixing is all commands are easy to find with command-line completion in `sf`.

Edzar Pebesma has extensive documentation, blog posts and vignettes available for `sf` here:
[Simple Features for R](https://github.com/edzer/sfr).  Additionally, see Edzar's [r-spatial blog](http://r-spatial.org/) which has numerous announcements, discussion pieces and tutorials on spatial work in R focused. 

A very handy page, if you're already familiar with the `sp` ecosystem, is the [Migrating](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/wiki/migrating) page on the [sf GitHub wiki](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/wiki).

Here's a quick synopsis of available methods in `sf`:
```{r sf_methods, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(sf)
methods(class = 'sf')
```

Let's start exploring `sf` using the USGS stream gage .csv file we read in previously.  You should still have the gages `data.frame` loaded in memory - if not, simply pull down from the class repository using code step from previous section.

```{r gages2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
class(gages)
```

Now we'll use the `sf` approach to make this `data.frame` with coordinates spatial, just as we did with `sp`:
```{r promote_gages_sf, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
gages_sf <- st_as_sf(gages, coords = c("LON_SITE", "LAT_SITE"), crs = 4269)
gages_sf
```

Let's break down what we just saw in gages_sf - from the first `sf` package vignette:
![`sf` Objects](/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/img/sf_structure.png)
We can see:

* in green a simple feature: a single record, or data.frame row, consisting of attributes and geometry
* in blue a single simple feature geometry (an object of class sfg)
* in red a simple feature list-column (an object of class sfc, which is a column in the data.frame)

Generic plotting works on `sf` objects as well - take a minute to play with plot our gages - why do we specify `$geometry` in our plot call?
```{r sf_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
plot(gages_sf$geometry, axes=T)
```


### Geographic Data I/O
For reading and writing vector and raster data in R, the three primary packages you'll use are:

 * `rgdal` or `sf` for vector formats such as [ESRI Shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile),  [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), and [GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) - both packages use **OGR**, which is a library under the [GDAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL) source tree,under the hood
 * `raster` for raster formats such as [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) or [ESRI or ASCII grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid) using [GDAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL) under the hood
