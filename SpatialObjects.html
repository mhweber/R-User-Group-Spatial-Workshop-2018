<h3>Spatial Data</h3>
<p>We can represent spatial data as discrete locations (points, lines or polygons) or as continuous phenomena without natural boundaries. We typically represent the former type of data (discrete locations) as <em>vector</em> data, with an associated geometry or shape, and some attributes with information about the locations. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>state boundaries with state name and population</li>
<li>rivers with their flow volume and names</li>
<li>polygons of watersheds with their names and associated landscape information</li>
</ul>
<p>We represent the latter type of data (continuous spatial fields) with <em>rasters</em> - these would be things such as elevation, precipitation, and atmospheric deposition for instance.</p>
<p>Basic data structures in R can represent spatial data - all we need is some vectors with location and attribute information - below we generate cites with population and make a map with a legend:</p>

<p>We can see in this toy example that numeric vectors can represent locations in R for simple mapping. Points just need to be a pair of numbers in cartesian space, and lines and polygons are just a number of these points (note that polygons are closed by having their first point coincide with last point which the <code>polygon</code> function in base R graphics takes care of).</p>
<p>You can do simple things with this spatial representation using basic R structures, but it breaks down quickly if you want to ask any spatial questions - for instance using the example above, how would we figure out the nearest city to Corvallis? Or imagine the polygon is a county and we wanted to know what cities are within the county?</p>
<p>So what information do we need to properly define spatial vector data and perform spatial operations?</p>
<ul>
<li>A coordinate reference system</li>
<li>A bounding box or extent</li>
<li>?</li>
</ul>

<div id="vector-data-with-sp" class="section level3">
<h3>Vector Data with sp</h3>
<p>We’re going to quickly review how spatial data was standardized in recent years using the base package <code>sp</code>. It’s informative to understand the structure of <code>sp</code> objects, and a number of packages still depend on <code>sp</code>, but this is changing rapidly and the R spatial vector world is rapdily moving toward adaptation of the newer <code>sf</code> package, so the bulk of our vector work will be using <code>sf</code>.</p>
<p>One reason it’s worth still going over <code>sp</code>, even though you’ll soon find <code>sf</code> is far superior in a number of ways, is that numerous packages are currently built using the <code>sp</code> object structure, so there’s a need to learn it to navigate current R spatial ecosystem. The image below is from <a href="https://twitter.com/csgillespie/status/854438264538845184">Colin Gillespie’s recent tweet</a> showing major packages and dependies in R:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/img/CRANdependencies.jpg" alt="CRANdependencies" />
<p class="caption">CRANdependencies</p>
</div>
<p>And below is a figure (with corresponding code you can run) that I put together based on a figure in <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/">Geocomputation with R</a> - the take home is that sp is still the most-used spatial package in R despite the growth of <code>sf</code>.</p>

<p>Handling of spatial data in R was standardized in recent years through the base package <code>sp</code>, which uses ‘new-style’ <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html">S4</a> classes in R that use formal class definitions and are closer to object-oriented systems than standard S3 classes in R.</p>
<p>The best source to learn about <code>sp</code> and fundamentals of spatial analysis in R is Roger Bivand’s book <a href="http://www.asdar-book.org/">Applied Spatial Data Analysis in R</a></p>
<p><code>sp</code> objects inherit from the basic spatial class, which has two ‘slots’ in R new-style class lingo. From the Bivand book above, here’s what this looks like (Blue at top of each box is the class name, items in white are the slots, arrows show inheritance between classes):</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at this in R - run the following R code in your R console (or from source):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(sp)

<p>We can see from this that a basic <code>sp</code> spatial object has to have two ‘slots’ - a bounding box and a ‘proj4string’ - this is the prefered format in R for a coordinate reference system (CRS) - either projected or unprojected. We can also see, from the figure above, that building off of the <code>Spatial</code> class, to have a <code>SpatialPoints</code>object we also need the actual matrix of coordinates that define those points. From there, we can build up to a <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> by simply adding a data frame of attributes to associate with those points. Let’s step through creating an <code>sp</code> <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> using our hypothetical cities data we created earlier.</p>

<p>We first created vectors of city names, latitude, longitude, and population. Then we made a matix of the longitude and latitude vectors (note that convention is always longitude first!). Then we construct a data frame of our city names and population. Finally, we use <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> as a method call on our matrix of coordinates and data frame to generate a <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> object.</p>
<p>Conveniently, our base R <code>plot</code> method works with our newly created <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code>, and we can add labels as well one way using the <code>maptools</code> package:</p>

<p>Meet your new friend the <code>@</code> symbol - this is how you access slots in an <code>S4</code> object in R - you can think of as similar to <code>$</code> in accessing columns in a data frame.</p>
<p>So to get the bounding box of our <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code>, we simply do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pts<span class="op">@</span>bbox</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##                min      max
## longitude -124.054 -121.313
## latitude    42.189   45.523</code></pre>
<p>Or you can use the method directly:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">bbox</span>(pts)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##                min      max

<h4><strong>A quick foray into coordinate reference systems and projections</strong></h4>
<p>Coordinate reference system, or CRS, information in <code>sp</code> uses the <code>proj4string</code> format. A very handy site to use to lookup any projection and get it’s <code>proj4string</code> format is <a href="http://spatialreference.org/">spatialreference.org</a>. A handy resource put together by Melanie Frazier for an R spatial workshop we did several years ago, is here: <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf">Overview of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) in R</a>.</p>
<p>Dealing with coordinate reference systems and projections is a big part of working with spatial data in R, and it’s relatively straightforward once you get the hang of it. Here are some of the fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRS can be geographic (lat/lon), projected, or NA in R</li>
<li>Data with different CRS MUST be transformed to common CRS in R</li>
<li>Projections in <code>sp</code> are provided in PROJ4 strings in the proj4string slot of an object</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spatialreference.org/" class="uri">http://www.spatialreference.org/</a></li>
<li>Useful <code>rgdal</code> package functions:
<ul>
<li>projInfo(type=‘datum’)</li>
<li>projInfo(type=‘ellps’)</li>
<li>projInfo(type=‘proj’)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For <code>sp</code> class objects:
<ul>
<li>To get the CRS: proj4string(x)</li>
<li>To assign the CRS:
<ul>
<li>Use either EPSG code or PROJ.4:
<ul>
<li>proj4string(x) &lt;- CRS(“+init=epsg:4269”)</li>
<li>proj4string(x) &lt;- CRS(“+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=WGS84”)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To transform CRS
<ul>
<li>x &lt;- spTransform(x, CRS(“+init=epsg:4238”))</li>
<li>x &lt;- spTransform(x, proj4string(y))</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For rasters (we’ll focus on rasters later, but mention projections here):
<ul>
<li>To get the CRS: projection(x)</li>
<li>To transform CRS: projectRaster(x)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To get back to our <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> we created, hopefully everyone realizes the issue with our original map shape was that our data was unprojected, and actually lacking any coordinate reference system information whatsoever. We have to supply this to our CRS slot for our pts <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code>. We know we’re using latitude and longitude values, and usually it’s safe to assume those are either NAD83 Datum or WGS84 - we don’t need to worry about delving into the details here. We can lookup the correct <code>proj4string</code> either using <a href="http://www.spatialreference.org/" class="uri">http://www.spatialreference.org/</a> or the <code>projInfo</code> method in the <code>rgdal</code> package.</p>
<p>Try one of these methods to get the CRS information we need to supply for our points.</p>

<p>Better - but what did you notice from summary(pts) above in the <code>proj4string</code> information?</p>
<p>We should not just use a geographic CRS, but project to a planar CRS for a better looking map - NAD83 / Oregon Lambert is a good choice - see if you can find the <code>proj4string</code> for this(hint: EPSG code is 2991) and take a minute to look through help for <code>sp</code> package and see if anyone knows how we’d get our pts to this projection.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a quick look at lines and polygons in <code>sp</code>. We’ll see how these objects are stored in <code>sp</code> to gain a basic understanding, but we’ll then move to the newer <code>sf</code> package for all our vector example exercises.</p>

<p>By contructing toy <code>SpatialLines</code> and <code>SpatialPolygons</code> <code>sp</code> objects, and then <code>SpatialLinesDataFrames</code> and <code>SpatialPolygonsDataFrames</code>, we can get a get a feel for the additional details needed to structure these using <code>sp</code>. Example here is from <a href="http://rspatial.org/spatial/rst/3-vectordata.html">R Spatial</a>. Here we use the <code>raster</code> package which has handy <code>spLines</code> and <code>spPolys</code> functions to create <code>SpatialLines</code> and <code>SpatialPolygons</code> from coordinates(<code>raster</code> package has several useful functions for dealing with vector data as well as raster data).</p>

<h3>Vector Data with sf</h3>
<p>The <code>sf</code> package developed by Edzer Pebesma ia an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features">Simple features</a>, an open standard developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Simple Features is a hierarchical data model that represents a wide range of geometry types - it includes all common vector geometry types (but does not include raster) and even allows geometry collections, which can have multiple geometry types in a single object. From the first <code>sf</code> package vignette we see:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/img/sf_objects.png" alt="sf Objects" />
<p class="caption"><code>sf</code> Objects</p>
</div>
<p>The big difference between <code>sf</code> and <code>sp</code> is that <code>sf</code> usesS3 classes rather than S4 as <code>sp</code> does. Simple features are simple <code>data.frame</code> objects that have a geometry list-column, essentially. <code>sf</code> rolls together the functions of three packages from the <code>sp</code> world - <code>sp</code> for the class system, <code>rgdal</code> for reading and writing data, and <code>rgeos</code> for spatial operations using <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/geos">GEOS</a>. The simple feature model will be familiar to folks who use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostGIS">PostGIS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL Spatial Extensions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Spatial_and_Graph">Oracle Spatial</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL">OGR component of the GDAL library</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7946/">GeoJSON</a> and <a href="http://geopandas.org/">GeoPandas</a> in Python. Simple features are represented with Well-Known text - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT</a> - and well-known binary formats.</p>
<p>Just as in <code>PostGIS</code>, all functions and methods in <code>sf</code> are prefixed with <code>st_</code>, which stands for ‘spatial and temporal’. An advantage of this prefixing is all commands are easy to find with command-line completion in <code>sf</code>.</p>
<p>Edzar Pebesma has extensive documentation, blog posts and vignettes available for <code>sf</code> here: <a href="https://github.com/edzer/sfr">Simple Features for R</a>. Additionally, see Edzar’s <a href="http://r-spatial.org/">r-spatial blog</a> which has numerous announcements, discussion pieces and tutorials on spatial work in R focused.</p>
<p>A very handy page, if you’re already familiar with the <code>sp</code> ecosystem, is the <a href="https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/wiki/migrating">Migrating</a> page on the <a href="https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/wiki">sf GitHub wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>Raster Data</h3>
<p>Package <code>sp</code> does have support for raster data, but we won’t look at it here - support for gridded data in R is best implemented currently with the <code>raster</code> package by Robert Hijmans. The <code>raster</code> package allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>read and write almost any commonly used raster data format using <code>rgdal</code></li>
<li>perform typical raster processing operations such as resampling, projecting, filtering, raster math, etc.</li>
<li>work with files on disk that are too big to read into memory in R</li>
<li>run operations quickly since the package relies on back-end C code</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/">home page</a> for the <code>raster</code> package has links to several well-written vignettes and documentation for the package.</p>
<p>The <code>raster</code> package uses three classes / types of objects to represent raster data - <code>RasterLayer</code>, <code>RasterStack</code>, and <code>RasterBrick</code> - these are all <code>S4</code> new style classes in R, just like <code>sp</code> classes.</p>
<p>The <code>raster</code> package has not been updated in the last year though- and a new package called <code>stars</code> (spatiotemporal tidy arrays with R) is being developed through an R-Consortium funded project to handle rasters in a way that is both <code>sf</code> and pipe-based workflow friendly. The <a href="https://github.com/r-spatial/stars/blob/master/PROPOSAL.md">proposal</a> by by Edzer Pebezma, Michael Sumer, Etienne Racine and Adriano Fantini outlines the approach they are taking - you can play with the <a href="https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2017/11/23/stars1.html">development version</a> and check out the package <a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html">web page</a> but it is still very much in alpha stages.</p>
<p>To familiarize ourselves with the <code>raster</code> package, let’s create an empty <code>RasterLayer</code> object - in order to do this we have to: * define the matrix (rows and columns) * define the spatial bounding box * provide values to the cells</p>
<p>Note that typically we would be reading raster data in from a file rather than creating a raster from scratch. Run through code steps below to familiarize yourself with contsructing a <code>RasterLayer</code> from scratch.</p>

<p>You see we have our usual <code>S4</code> slot structure with a <code>RasterLayer</code> object. Simply typing the name of the <code>RasterLayer</code> gives a succinct summary of the object at the console.</p>

<p>A few quick questions to work through-</p>
<ul>
<li>what is the minimal data required to define a <code>RasterLayer</code>?</li>
<li>What is odd here about the CRS?</li>
<li>Based on our work with <code>sp</code>, how do we pull out just the CRS for our r <code>rasterLayer</code>? Hint - what is another way besides str(r) to see slots available with our <code>RasterLayer</code> r?</li>
<li>Building on this, what is the code to pull out just our xmin value in our extent, or bounding box?</li>
</ul>

<p>So far we just have a container with no values (try plotting what we have so far) - let’s provide values to the cells using the runif function to derive random values from the uniform distribution</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">r[] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">runif</span>(<span class="dt">n=</span><span class="kw">ncell</span>(r))

<p>Notice the different output now when typing ‘r?’ An important point to make here is that objects in the <code>raster</code> package can be either in memory or on disk - not the value for our <code>RasterLayer</code> r of ‘data source’. If this were a large raster on disk, the value would be the path to the file on disk.</p>
<p>We can test this as well using methods in <code>raster</code> (and test if the raster has values too):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">inMemory</span>(r)</code></pre></div>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">hasValues</span>(r)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>We can plot now as well with base R <code>plot</code>:</p>

<p><img src="SpatialObjects_files/figure-html/plot%20raster-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can also overwrite the cell values for our raster:</p>

<p>You can access raster values via direct indexing or line, column indexing - take a minute to see how this works using raster r we just created - the syntax is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">r[i]
r[line, column]</code></pre></div>
<p>How is <code>raster</code> data storage unlike a <code>matrix</code> in R? You can create a <code>matrix</code> with same dimensions and values and compare if you want:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">m &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">matrix</span> (<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dt">nrow=</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">ncol=</span><span class="dv">10</span>)

<p><code>RasterBrick</code> and <code>RasterStack</code> are the two additional classes in <code>raster</code> and handle multiple raster layers. They differ from each other in how they handle multiple layers, file formats they support, their representation and their processing speed. A <code>RasterBrick</code> typicallly is a single multi-layer file such as a multispectral image. A <code>RasterStack</code> can virtually connect several <code>RasterLayer</code> objects in memory and allows pixel-based calculations on separate raster layers, while a <code>RasterBrick</code> has to refer to a single multi-layer file or multi-layer object. Note that methods that operate on either a <code>RasterStack</code> or <code>RasterBrick</code> usually return a <code>RasterBrick</code>, and processing will be mor efficient on a <code>RasterBrick</code> object.</p>
<p>It’s easy to manipulate our <code>RasterLayer</code> to make a couple new layers, and then stack layers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">r2 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>r <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">50</span>

<h3>Geographic Data I/O</h3>
<p>For reading and writing vector and raster data in R, the three primary packages you’ll use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rgdal</code> or <code>sf</code> for vector formats such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">ESRI Shapefiles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format">GPX</a> - both packages use <strong>OGR</strong>, which is a library under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL">GDAL</a> source tree,under the hood</li>
<li><code>raster</code> for raster formats such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF">GeoTIFF</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid">ESRI or ASCII grid</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL">GDAL</a> under the hood</li>
</ul>
<p>We can quickly discover supported I/O vector formats either via <code>rgdal</code> or <code>sf</code>:</p>

<p>Both <code>rgdal</code> and <code>sf</code> support about every vector format you would need. Typically working with vector GIS data we work with ESRI shapefiles or geodatabases - here we have an example of how one would read in either format using <code>sf</code>:</p>

<p>There is a weatlh of open spatial data accessible online now via static URLs or APIs - a few examples include <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?metadata_type=geospatial">Data.gov</a>, NASA <a href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/">SECAC Portal</a>, <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, <a href="http://geodata.grid.unep.ch/">UNEP GEOdata</a>, and countless others listed here at <a href="https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/">Free GIS Data</a>.</p>
<p>From static URLs, we can simply use <code>download.file()</code> as in this example from <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html">Geocomputation with R</a> using data from the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-parks">National Park data catalog</a>:</p>

<p>Below is an example of pulling in US states using the <code>rnaturalearth</code> package - note that the default is to pull in data as <code>sp</code> objects and we coerce to <code>sf</code>. Also take a look at the chained operation using dplyr and see if this makes sense to you - we’ll eplore more in following section. Try changing the filter or a parameter in ggplot.</p>

<p>Part of the fun (or consternation) of R, and spatial work in R, is the pace of development of new packages. I like scanning for new spatial packages and trying to incorporate into my workflow - <a href="https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/index.html">tidycensus</a> is a brand new and very handy package - note that you’ll have to <a href="http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html">request</a> a Census Data API key to run this code - so just you can just examine code below for now.</p>

<p>Here we use the <code>getData</code> function in the <code>raster</code> package to download elevation into a <code>RasterLayer</code> and grab administrative boundaries from a database of global administrative boundaries - warning: sometimes <code>getData</code> function has trouble accessing the server and download can be a bit slow. Here we see as well how we can use vector spataio polygon data to crop raster data.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata">osmdata</a> package is a fantastic resource for leveraging the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database - I’ve used on work projects as a source for looking at proximity to recreation and trails for ecosystem function. Here we’ll get a previw of our mapping section coming up later - try playing with this osmdata and see if you can pull out something else around the area - parks for instance.</p>
